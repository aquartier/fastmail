FastMail demonstrates using the setup generated by `create-react-app` alongside a Node.js Express API server. 

This application also using proxy technique to prevent issues with CORS. By proxy all API requests directly to backend which specify in package.json

```js
// Inside client/package.json
"proxy": "http://localhost:4000/",
```


## Prerequisites
 - Node.js >= 8.0 
 - Mongo DB >= 3.0
 - Sendgrid API Key
 - Mailgun API Key

## Usage

Copy `.env.example` and rename the file name to `.env` . Then modify your API keys before start the app.
``` bash
# Install node modules.
yarn && cd client && yarn

# Run the aplication.
yarn start
```
Alternatively, you can use npm by replacing `yarn` with `npm`.

This setup uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) for process management. Executing `npm start` instructs `concurrently` to boot both the Webpack dev server (client) and the API server.

## Project Structure

| Name                               | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **client**             | React application generated from 'create-react-app'.  |
| **client**/src             | All frontend sourcecode that I made for this project.  |
| **lib**/             | All 3rd libraries including MongoDB, Sendgrid and Mailgun.              |
| **services**/         | Like controller in modern MVC pattern. But I call them service because it's including data layer inside. All application logics are located here.                                 |
| **api.js**            | Entry file, map all routes to services and handle all express configuration.                            |
| **client.js**         | Just a proxy script command.                            |
| package.json                       | NPM dependencies.                                            |
